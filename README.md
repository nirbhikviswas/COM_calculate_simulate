# 3D Center of Mass Calculator & Simulator

An interactive, web-based tool for calculating the center of mass for a system of point masses in both symbolic and numerical forms, featuring a real-time 3D visualization.

## Features

### Dual Calculator Modes:
- **Symbolic Calculator:** Input variables for masses and positions (m1, x1, etc.) to get a formula for the center of mass.
- **Numerical Calculator:** Input floating-point values for mass and position to get a precise calculation.

### Interactive 3D Simulation:
- Visualizes the masses and the calculated center of mass in a 3D space.
- Orbit controls (rotate, pan, zoom) to inspect the system from any angle.
- Z-axis is oriented vertically.

### Customization:
- Theme Switching: Toggle between a sleek dark mode and a clean light mode.
- Color Picker: Assign custom colors to each mass, which are then rendered in the simulation.

### User-Friendly Interface:
- Modern, responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices.
- Glassmorphism-inspired UI with interactive animations.
- Dynamically add or remove masses from the calculation.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Calculator:** Choose between the "Symbolic" and "Numerical & Sim" tabs.

2. **Input Data:**  
   - For Symbolic, enter comma-separated variables for masses and their corresponding coordinates.  
   - For Numerical, click "Add Mass" to create input fields. Enter the mass (kg) and X, Y, Z positions (m) for each object. Use the color picker to customize its appearance.

3. **Calculate:**  
   - Click "Calculate" in the symbolic tab or "Calculate & Simulate" in the numerical tab.

4. **View Results:**  
   - The calculated formula or coordinates will appear in the result box.  
   - The 3D simulation will update instantly with the positions and colors you've set.
